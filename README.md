🔒 **Secure WebSocket Chat Application**
A secure, real-time messaging application built with Python. This project demonstrartes End-to-End Encrpytion (E2EE) using AES-18, implemented via the Fernet module, over a WebSocket connection using Tkinter for the Gui.
This project was developed as a coursework assignment for **Introduction to programming.**

✨ Key Features
**End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Messages are encrypted using Fernet (AES-128 in CBC mode) before leaving the sender's machine and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
**WebSocket Protocol**: Uses websockets library for low-latency, full-duplex communication.
Asynchronous Architecture: Implements asyncio for handling concurrent network operations without freezing the GUI.
**Key Derivation**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to derive a secure 32-byte encryption key from a user-provided text password.
**Hacker-Grade Interface**: A dark-themed Terminal GUI designed to look like a cybersecurity tool.
